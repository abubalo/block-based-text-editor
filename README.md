# Text Editor

This code provides a simplified version of a block-based editor. It demonstrates the basic structure and functionality of creating different types of content blocks and rendering them in a wrapper element.

Each block type (ParagraphBlock, HeadingBlock, ImageBlock, LinkBlock) extends the Block class and adds its specific rendering logic and event handling. The Block class itself provides a common structure for storing and saving block data.

While the simplified version lacks many advanced features and complexities of a full-featured rich text editor, it serves as a starting point for understanding the basic principles of building such an editor. From here, you can expand and enhance the code to add more features and customization options based on your specific requirements.
